This program prints the Fibonacci Sequence in Java.

Example 1 - 

- Number of Terms = 5

- Fibonacci Sequence = 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3

- Process = 0 -> 0+1 = 1 -> 1+1 = 2 -> 1+2 = 3

Example 2 - 

- Number of Terms = 10

- Fibonacci Sequence = 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34

- Process = 0 -> 0+1 = 1 -> 1+1 = 2 -> 1+2 = 3 -> 3+2 = 5 -> 5+3 = 8 -> 8+5 = 13 -> 13+8 = 21 -> 21+13 = 34



-- Starting two terms are fixed i.e 0 and 1

-- we can also start the sequence by 1

-- we have to add the previous two terms to get the third term
